<!--Title/Intro-->

<h1 class="p2" id="rcorners2">World Of Monsters Concept Art <br> 
</h1>




<p class="p1" id="rcorners1">Hello, my name is Wayne Landon Hearns II and my blog is going to be about Concept art. Ever since I was a child I have loved drawing, and as I got older, I realized that there were a lot of routes you can go with drawing. You can go animation, graphic design, Industrial design, Environmental or Comics, but I realized I had passion for being a Monster concept artist/digital illustrator. That is my passion and that is my main goal so I thought it would be cool to post about other different amazing concept artists to motivate others and to share different work from great concept artist that are in the industry.
